\section{INTRODUCTION}
This is a two-player Angry Birds Showdown. First one to destroy all of the opponent's blocks wins. All the birds have their own unique special ability and induce variable damage based on their type, speed etc.

\section{About the birds}

    \label{fig : RED}
\end{figure}

\subsection{RED}

Red does equal damage to all the blocks for a given speed.

Special Ability : It can transform into giant red which is very very powerful and does maximum damage possible. 

Usage : It's special ability can be only used once per player.

    \label{fig : CHUCK}
\end{figure}
\subsection{CHUCK}


Chuck does more damage to wood blocks and less damage to others for a given speed.

Special Ability : Super Speed
It attains really high speed which increases it's damage.

Usage : Unlimited. A player can use it's special ability everytime.

\subsection{BLUE}
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.2\textwidth]{../Resources/small_blue.png}
    \caption{BLUE}
    \label{fig : BLUE}
\end{figure}


Blue does more damage to ice blocks and less damage to others for the same speed.

Special Ability : Triplify
It can multiply into 3 and triple it's attack area and increase damage.

Usage : Unlimited. A player can use it's special ability everytime.




\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.2\textwidth]{../Resources/bomb.png}
    \caption{BOMB}
    \label{fig : BOMB}
\end{figure}
\subsection{BOMB}
Bomb does more damage to stone blocks and less damage to others for the same speed.

Special Ability : Bomb
It can burst upon collision and induce heavy damage on all the blocks. 

Usage : It's usage is a gamble. Both players combined can use this ability a total of n times where n is a randomly generated number in the range of 0 to 5. So it may happen that neither player gets to use this ability in a match. Moreover you must time your usage of this ability as the number of times you can use it also depends upon your opponent.

\section{MODULES}
\begin{description}
    \item[pygame-ce]: An actively maintained and updated version of the original pygame library offering enhanced support, bug-fixes and compatability with modern python versions for game-dev. This module has been used throughout the game 
    \item[random]: The random module in Python implements pseudo-random number generators for various distributions, and also provides functions for random operations on sequences, such as shuffling. I have used this module at instances such as random player activation and assigning maximum bomb ability usage.
    \item[os]: The os module in Python provides functions for interacting with the operating system. I have used it for the new-game button that restarts the program.
    \item[sys]: The sys module in Python provides access to system-specific parameters and functions, enabling interaction with the Python runtime environment. This again I used for new-game button and to terminate the current program.
    \item[math]: The math module in Python is a built-in library providing access to a wide range of mathematical functions and constants. I have used it to get access to trigonometric functions and add modifications to the projectile.

\subsection{Various Implementations In The Code}

For Pygame functions I referred to the documentaion of 
pygame\cite{pygameDoc} and pygame-ce\cite{pygameCEDoc}
For sprite images I used reference image generation tools and open
source websites\cite{ImagesAndBGs}.
For inspiration, I went through some single-player Implementations
which helped me ideate and formulate my own game.\cite{ReferenceProjects}

\subsubsection{Customizations in the game}
A list of Customizations made in the game
\begin{itemize}
